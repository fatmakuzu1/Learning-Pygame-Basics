# 🎮 Pygame Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step progress in mastering game development and simulation logic using **Python** and the **Pygame** library

## 📚 Project Milestones

`shapeDrawing2.py` | **Rendering** | Drawing primitive shapes (lines, circles, rectangles). 
`imageCreation3.py` | **Assets** | Loading external PNG images and managing their bounds. 
`textRendering4.py` | **UI Basics** | Working with system fonts and rendering dynamic text. 
`soundAndMusic5.py` | **Audio** | Implementing background music loops and sound effects. 
`keyboardCharacterControl6.py` | **Discrete Input** | Moving objects using individual key-down events. 
`mouseCharacterControl7.py` | **Mouse Control** | Capturing mouse coordinates to move objects on screen. 
`keyboardContinuityAndFPS8.py` | **FPS & Continuity** | Stabilizing frame rates and handling continuous movement. 
`windowBoundaryLimit9.py` | **Boundaries** | Creating constraints to keep objects within the viewport. 
`collisionDetection10.py` | **Physics** | Detecting interactions and overlaps between game objects.
